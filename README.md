# Rock-paper-scisors-game(against computer)
This is a basic level game using python which depicts the use of random module , if-else statement and an operator. 
In this I am using randint function of random module to assign some value to variable named computer so that it gives a feel of computer playing against usser.
After this the result is diplayed on some conditions incuding the use of operators.
